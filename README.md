- 👋 Hi, I’m @Migu-404
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Science- Mainly Web Development & Coding, but I do love the hardware aspect of technology as well.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, C#, and maybe Python (in the near future)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Website Coding, Mobile apps, or new tech ideas.
- 📫 How to reach me: Github is probably the best way (for now) to reach out to me.
